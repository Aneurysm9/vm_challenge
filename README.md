# Synacor Challenge

This repository holds my copy of the architecture specification and challenge
binary from the Synacor Challenge as presented at OSCON 2012.  It is preserved
for historical and educational purposes.  

## Codes

I have included MD5 hashes of the eight codes produced by this instance of the
challenge for use in testing implementations of the architecture.  These codes
can be validated as follows, replacing the quoted string with the code to test:

```console
$ echo -n "<Code Here>" | md5sum
